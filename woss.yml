- title: Personal Information
  fields:
  - - Name
    - Danijel Maricic
  - - Date of Birth
    - 07<sup>th</sup> of January, 1984
  - - Languages
    - Croatian (mother tongue), English (fluent in conversation and writing, including
      IT terminology)

- title: Summary
  largeList:
  - I also enjoy learning and doing the necessary things myself when there is a need
    for it. This has led me to have the ability to fill multiple roles in an organization,
    and to understand a wide variety of technologies. When necessary I can build the
    product from scratch, from installing the servers, to building the backend, frontend,
    and continuous delivery systems, as well as all the integrations and tools necessary
    to support operating it.
  - I enjoy mostly working at a free pace, where I don't need to worry about working
    hours or days, but focus on the results and getting things done. However, I have
    been in many stressful situations over the year and excel at times of urgent need.
    I can put the necessary time into solving any problem I'm facing, no matter how
    obscure and frustrating. When I get the time to think of a problem properly I
    can frequently come up with creative new suggestions on how to get the necessary
    results.
  - I take pride in my ability to choose the right tool for the job, deciding when
    a homegrown solution is needed and when a 3rd party solution is much more cost
    effective. I don't choose technologies just because I have a history with them,
    or because "everyone uses them", I choose technologies because they are perfect
    for the job.
- title: Recent experience
  largeList:
  - Most recently I've been working heavily on Python and Go, with some JavaScript
    on the side. I'm also quite comfortable with Google Cloud Platform, Cordova (cross-platform
    mobile application framework), and continuous integration & delivery systems.
  - I'm most comfortable in small to medium-sized startups, where I like to take a
    large role and take lots of responsibility. I've been designing software for medium
    sized server environments with dozens of servers for years, ensuring cost-effective
    scalability and high availability, while keeping releases rock solid.
  - I have done everything from managing product backlog, hiring talented team members,
    to building product prototypes. I am a big fan of Infrastructure as Code (IaC),
    and DevOps practices in general.
